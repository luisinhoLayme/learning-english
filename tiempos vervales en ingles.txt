Para conseguir el gerundio de un verbo en inglés debemos añadir “ing” a su infinitivo, por ejemplo:

Walk > walking
Andar > andando

En el caso de que el verbo termine en “e” muda, suprimiremos esa “e”, por ejemplo:

Write > writing

Si el verbo es monosílabo y termina en consonante-vocal-consonante, duplicaremos su última consonante, por ejemplo:

Cut > cutting

<!--=====================================
=            Tiempos perfectos
======================================-->
Los tiempos perfectos en inglés se forman conjugando el verbo “to have” (traducido al español con el significado de “haber”) y utilizando el participio del verbo principal. Por ejemplo

*Presente continuo
	-Forma afirmativa: I have lost > yo he perdido
	-Forma negativa: I haven't lost > yo no he perdido
	-Forma interrogativa: have I lost? > he perdido yo?

*Pasado continuo
	-Forma afirmativa: I had lost > yo habia perdido
	-Forma negativa: I hadn't lost > yo no habia perdido
	-Forma interrogativa: had I lost? > habia perdido yo?

*Futuro continuo
	-Forma afirmativa: I will have blown > yo habre soplado
	-Forma negativa: I won't have blown > yo no habre soplado
	-Forma interrogativa: will I have blown? > habre soplado yo?

*Condicional continuo
	-Forma afirmativa: I would have broken > yo habria roto
	-Forma negativa: I wouldn't have broken > yo no habria roto
	Forma interrogativa: would I have broken? > habria roto yo?

Para formar el participio de un verbo en inglés debemos distinguir si se trata de un verbo regular o irregular.

Si es un verbo regular añadiremos “ed” al infinitivo:

Walk > walked
Andar > Andado

Si, en cambio, se trata de un verbo irregular deberemos aprender de memoria su forma en participio (la tercera columna de los verbos irregulares), por ejemplo:

Buy > bought
Comprar > comprado
